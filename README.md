Hello! This is the open-Source version of my first plugin :P

If you want to use the plugin in-roblox, Then go to this link:
https://create.roblox.com/store/asset/18914545498/EZ-Script-Maker

Feel free to do whatever you'd like with the code, If you want to send me your edits, Do it via: https://discord.gg/nDStJYjYE4 And create a ticket.

How to use:

It's quite a simple concept, But all you really need to do is select what you want the script to be parented to (So lets say a part in a folder in workspace).

And when you press the corresponding button (Eg, Script for server, Module for module and local for local) It creates a script there.
